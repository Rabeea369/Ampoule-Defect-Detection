# Ampoule-Defect-Detection
Detecting and classifying defects on Ampoule medicinal bottles, complete with GUI

Factories producing ampoule medicinal bottles have encountered occasional damage issues. To address this, an AI-based system was developed. It captures images of bottles on the conveyor belt, automatically detecting and classifying defects, such as lines, scratches, or imprints. This system offers two solutions: one employing image processing for defect detection and classification, and another using trained SVM models. Users can choose from three sensitivity levels: low, medium, or high. Results are stored in CSV files categorized by date (day, month, year). Additionally, a front-end GUI simplifies user interaction and control.
